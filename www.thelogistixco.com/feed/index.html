										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Ian is due to touch down on the U.S. coast sometime later this afternoon, and though the storm is slated to hit Southern Florida, the effects of the storm are sure to be felt across the country. Ian, which has been upgraded to a category 5 hurricane, is projected to move through the Tampa Bay area; over 2,800 manufacturing firms in automotive components, heavy machinery, chemicals and plastics, as well as about 7,000 health care producers in pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics and other fields, will be affected by strong winds, flooding, and power outages. Experts are predicting severe supply chain disruptions from Ian, which will directly affect freight movement through major port, airport, highway and rail nodes. Everstream Analytics, an analytic group dedicated to risk scores and insights regarding the world’s supply chain system, said the sector facing the biggest harm is agriculture, as harvest season starts in early November. High winds and floods can cause unsalvageable harm to crops, which will in turn cause truckers to see less business if there are less crops to transport. This alone will exacerbate high food prices and inflation.</p>
<p>Several ports and their container terminals have already either closed or stopped inbound traffic in efforts to reduce the risk of harm to goods and workers. These include Port Tampa Bay and Seaport Manatee, both of which handle large quantities of steel, fertilizer and other non-containerized goods. Port Tampa Bay specializes in imports of food and beverage products, as well as fuel. Other ports, such as Port of Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, have issues advisories for tropical storms later this week. As for air cargo, Tampa International Airport has shut down, in addition to the Orlando International Airport. Hurricane Ian, in combination with Typhoon Noru, which is currently upsetting supply chains in Southeast Asia, are anticipated to catalyze a next string of supply disruptions. An Article published by American Shipper dives further into the details regarding the hurricane’s path, as well as the freight transport constraints.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Freight shipments have gone up 3.6% – more than a four-year high in August of 2022. This is according to the Cass information system, a shipment index that measures the number of intercontinental freight shipments across north America that tracks everything from raw materials to finished goods. Stronger Cass data is indicative of the ongoing shift from spot to contracted shipments. As load opportunities have fallen, a large number of drivers are making the switch to operate under their own authority, which has upset a tight supply and demand dynamic. An article published by Freight Waves accounts the current trend within the trucking industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The railroad strike has been narrowly averted after a 20-hour negotiation meeting between unions and rail management. The two parties were able to reach a tentative deal early on Thursday, September 15<sup>th</sup>, with involvement from the United States President, Joe Biden. Railroad workers are governed by different labor laws compared to most workers, one that limits their freedom to strike and allows for more governmental intervention. If a nationwide rail strike had occurred, it would have been the first in more than 30 years. It also threatened to cost the U.S. $2 billion in lost economic output for every day not in operation. While most of the details of the agreement have not been shared publicly, one of the accepted terms of the deal would provide an immediate pay raise wage increase of 24% over a 5 year span from 2020 to 2024, including back pay, and bonuses of $5000 with on average per member. Jeremy Ferguson, president of the conductors’ union and one of the leading individuals involved in the meeting, said that they were able to address a key concern, which was absences due to medical events. The agreement also reportedly provides an extra paid day off per worker and will allow changes to the employee attendance policies enacted by railroads during the COVID-19 Pandemic with the stated purpose of increasing service consistency. &#8220;We&#8217;re very proud of what was accomplished,&#8221; said Ferguson. &#8220;Everybody pulled together to make sure that we could get our members what they deserved.&#8221; Union members will now vote on whether to approve the tentative agreement. An article published by Freight Waves reports on the railway negotiations in detail.</p>

<p>As some are already aware, two rail unions have not officially accepted contract negotiations, and are poised, though not officially committed, to a work halt. In anticipation of this, certain commodities have already been limited in their ability to be transported, citing need to ensure the safety of these shipments, as well as the people in charge of handling them. Some of these commodities include hazardous materials, intermodal equipment, reefer equipment, and certain time sensitive shipments.</p>
<p>While we will continue provide realistic pricing and monitor existing intermodal loads, we recommend remaining flexible regarding the pick-up situation, and also suggest trying to plan shipments as far in advance as possible in efforts to prevent unforeseen lead times as a result of the circumstances. We are making these recommendations for all shipment types, as the potential rail work stoppage is anticipated to have long reaching repercussions for alternative forms of transportation, especially for over the road trucking capacity.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued partnership with The Logistix Company, and we will continue to monitor and report the situation on the railroads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Class I railroads are making arrangements to keep in compliance with federal regulations in anticipation of a strike occurring on September 16<sup>th</sup>. Preparation includes suspending shipments of hazardous materials and security-sensitive shipments. In response to new contract negotiations, 10 out of 12 unions are in position to accept new conditions. The two non-confirmed unions are in position, but not yet committed to strike over not reaching terms they deem acceptable. In attempts to predict and mitigate issues, Norfolk Southern Chief Marketing Officer Ed Elkins has gone ahead to clarify with the public the measures that the railroads will be taking to ensure the safety of shipments and the people tasked with handling them. “We must take steps to ensure we can shut down operations safely if a strike occurs and be positioned to restart quickly when operations resume. Most importantly, we must ensure that no hazardous material or freight that requires special security is left on an unattended train out on the network in the event of a sudden strike,” said Elkins. An article published by Freight Waves outlines the conditions surrounding this potential strike.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. ports are bloated due to congestion, and the only solution is to alleviate it is time. Currently, the average dock time is over at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach is up to 30 days. The average on-dock rail dwell over at the ports is 12 days – with no immediate relief in sight, containers are stacking up at multiple terminals.One positive in this otherwise overwhelming situation comes from the ports of Oakland, California, who have been able to cut down the backlog of containers as a result of the trucker strike in early July. As anyone in the logistics world knows, optimism goes hand-in-hand with skepticism, as any one unexpected event can cause everything to slow or stop altogether. An article published by American Shipper reports further on the current congestion experienced at ports, and potential opportunities and threats supply chains may face in the near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Commerce giants like Walmart and Target have recently gone on record to say that they’ve canceled billions of dollars in orders to help align their inventories with expected demand. Regardless, U.S. import activities remain at all-time highs. According to data released by Descartes, the world’s largest database of import trade statistics, U.S. imports were up 3% in July from 2019, pre-pandemic numbers. It was the best July on record, with volumes up 2% from June. July marked the fifth-highest monthly volume ever recorded by Descartes, and experts say that import volumes continue to look strong midway through August. Despite the excess in inventories held by retailers like Walmart and Target, consumer demand remains strong. July retail sales, when adjusted for inflation and seasonality, were up .5% from June and .3% for year over year.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ports have turned their full attention towards making the supply chain process as smooth as possible for customers and cargo owners. East Coast ports have been experiencing higher volumes as shippers attempt to avoid port congestion in the West Coast ports. The increased activity has resulted in growth at some ports while others are experiencing processing backups. The Port of Virginia, in particular, believes that this could be their best performing calendar year on record, especially if the flow of shipments remains strong throughout peak retail months. The ports of South Carolina, in response to the uptick in activity, have extended their Sunday gate hours for motor carriers; they plan to keep these extended hours through to the peak retail season. The SC ports are also giving berth priority to vessels taking out more cargo, launched a port-owned and port-operated chassis pool and hired more employees to handle the influx of cargo. SC Ports said as a result, they’ve had significantly improved rail dray dwell times. An article published by American Shipper reports on the operational changes at East Coast ports further.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What are The Logistix Company’s (TLC) core business units and areas of focus?<br />
</strong><strong>A: </strong>TLC got its start working closely with distribution companies moving liquid bulk chemicals. After time, we expanded our business to moving a multitude of commodities in bulk tankers, dry vans, intermodally via rail, repackaging, warehousing, and international freight forwarding.</p>
<p><strong>Q: H</strong><strong>ow do you see the third-party logistics market in relation to the logistics industry?<br />
</strong><strong>A: </strong>Third party logistics and logistic brokers play a vital role in connecting small/medium-sized businesses to the wider logistics market. Smaller businesses might not have the resources available to have dedicated personnel to develop relationships with carriers, or know where certain market values should be for their freight. At TLC, we strive to empower these businesses and place importance on developing those relationships with both existing and new carriers. We’re always looking to the future for growth opportunities, and this attitude allows us to remain competitive while maintaining positive relationships with our customers. It also permits us to expand our coverage footprint &#8211; giving our customers more access to shipping locations, as well as leveraging negotiating power.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why should a shipper consider working with a third-party logistics company compared to asset-based or owner-operator firms?<br />
</strong><strong>A: </strong>A third-party logistics company works with many different carriers with a multitude of capabilities over a larger area, as opposed to working with asset-based/owner-ops that tend to have extremely limited capabilities or coverage areas.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is one piece of advice you give to your customers?</strong><br />
<strong>A: </strong>“Make your freight more attractive”. We have found the most success in securing capacity on businesses that cast the widest net in terms of options. Whenever we’re able to present carriers with an acceptable delivery “range” (as opposed to a single, strict appointment), or locations that have their own dedicated offloading equipment (hoses, pumps, etc.), we have noticed higher acceptance rates on the carriers’ part. TLC dedicates itself to working closely with our customers to make sure their freight needs are attractive to the right carriers, so that their entire supply chain runs as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How has the market moved towards rail and intermodal, compared to liquid bulk and dry van freight? </strong><br />
<strong>A: </strong>Intermodal and rail are typically a cheaper alternative to shipping commodities that are less time-sensitive in their delivery windows. However, there is a positive correlation that people tend to worry less about the time-sensitivity of using intermodal and rail when OTR (Over the Road) dry vans/tankers become more expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What strengths does TLC possess as a third-party logistics broker?<br />
</strong><strong>A: </strong>TLC offers a wide range of different capabilities pertinent to logistics. Our tracking and communication technologies allows us to partner with carriers, warehouses, and repackaging facilities, while being able to relay up-to-date information to our customers at a moment’s notic</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Harbor Truck Association (HTA) reported that on July 13<sup>th</sup>, harbor truckers were protesting at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach after the U.S. Supreme Court decision not to challenge California’s Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), also commonly referred to as the “Gig-worker bill”. Many companies that hire truckers to move their goods are less than thrilled by the bill, as it would require companies to reclassify truckers previously considered as independent contractors as employees. With the title of “employee”, it would qualify the truckers for paid time off, medical coverage, rest breaks, and minimum wage, among other benefits.</p>
<p>Though this is seen as agreeable for some truck drivers, others who sincerely wish to operate as an independent driver see it as a threat to their livelihoods, as the bill would inherently prevent some drivers from accepting contracts from other trucking companies. When voicing concerns for truckers who wish to establish this independent status to the Supreme Court over unclear or generally vague guidelines in the bill, it fell on deaf ears. As stated by Matt Schrap, CEO of the HTA, “Unfortunately, it didn’t matter how many independent drivers stood up and expressed concerns during the legislative process for AB5 in 2019, they were basically ignored and essentially told by the Governor and the legislature what was best for them and their families.”</p>
<p>AB5 initially went into effect on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020, but has been blocked from being implemented due to an injunction handed down by a U.S. District Court in California the same month. That injunction has kept the block in place up until current day, though it could be lifted “any day now,” according to HTA. An article published by the American Journal of Transportation reports further on the protest and the sentiment between the HTA and AB5.</p>
